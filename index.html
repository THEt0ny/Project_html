                    <p class="paragraph-4">
                        Paul really didn't have much hobbies but the two that he had was cars and marine life (everything ocean related). Just to remind you Paul studied in marine biology before the start of his
                        acting career and in his free time he would fund marine life foundations millions and even created one to his name. Paul spent his time to help raise money for charities too.
                        His other hobbie for cars isn't a surprise. He holds a massive car collection shared with his dear friend Roger Rodas. The complet list of his collection 
                        can be found <a href="car.html">here</a>.

                    <p class="paragraph-5">
                        As we all know by now Paul life didn't end on a good note. His life ended after his friend Roger Rodas who was behind the wheel of Paul's red Porsche Carrera GT 2005.
                        Lost control of the car and hit a parking tree at about 100 miles an hour. Paul and Rodas perished in the burning car on November 30, 2012.
